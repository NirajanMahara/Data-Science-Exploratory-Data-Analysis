Hello Everyone, 

I hope this post finds you well.

## Today I found something more interesting than Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

As we all know, data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets.

So, for proper data visualization, I have prepared a small program that allows you to create interactive plots that you can use in dashboards or websites 

### <b>Note: We can save them as HTML files or static images</b>

<b>Installation</b>

In order for this all to work, you'll need to install Plotly and Cufflinks to call plots directly off of a pandas data frame. These libraries are not currently available through conda but are available through pip. Install the libraries at your command line/terminal using:

`>>> !pip install plotly`

`>>> !pip install cufflinks`

### <b>NOTE: Make sure you only have one installation of Python on your computer when you do this, otherwise the installation may not work.</b>
