# 10 Commandments of Data Science


1. Focus mainly on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.

2. Data will never be clean or easily available. Data gathering and cleaning will take 80% of your time and efforts.

3. Don’t underestimate the power of Excel and SQL - they are still two of the most useful tools for data analysis.

4. Simple models such as Linear or Logistic Regression will be good enough for many problems. You don’t need neural networks to solve every problem.

5. Textbook solutions may not work for most practical problems. You will need to try new approaches and innovate as required.

6. Nobody can remember everything. On the job, you can always use Google, Stack Overflow etc.

7. Learn Data Visualisation and develop the ability to explain your key insights in simple terms - such skills will be very useful with non-technical and business stakeholders.

8. Learn PowerPoint and storytelling - people may not appreciate your great work if you can’t convince them with your story.

9. Data Science is evolving rapidly. Please learn continuously, else you may become obsolete soon.

10. Focus mainly on solving the problem and not on tools, technologies, and models.
